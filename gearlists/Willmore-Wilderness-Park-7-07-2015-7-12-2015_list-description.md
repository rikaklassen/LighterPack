# Post-Trip Notes
## Pack Shakedown
Time-weight
### The Big Threes
#### Stone Glacier Solo with KRuX
A massive upgrade from the [Osprey Ariel 65L].
#### MSR Hubba Hubba NX
[ZPack Duplex](https://zpacks.com/products/duplex-tent) (539 g), Tarptent, [Mountain Laurel Designs Trailstar], [Seek Outside BT-2](http://store.seekoutside.com/beyond-timberline-2-bt-2/), LBO or Cimarron.
#### Enlightened Equipment Revelation Elite 30ºF
### Cooking and Hydration
#### Kovea Spider
Girlfriend was amazed by how quick a canister stove is to prime and boil. She was used to having to wait for the Trangia and SuperCat alcohol stoves to bloom then boil.

The [Kovea Spider] remote canister stove (168 g). [Fire Maple FMS-118 Volcano] (146 g) with the pre-heating tubes and the [FMS-117T Blade] (98 g) lacks pre-heating tube. [Roger Caffin](http://www.backpackinglight.com/cgi-bin/backpackinglight/caffin-evolution-of-winter-stove-part-3.html) offers custom-made remote canister stoves (90 g) exclusively for Backpacking Light subscribers by cannibalizing [Fire Maple 300T Hornet] burner heads.

One can go even lighter without the hose and stand by investing into a topper: [BRS-3000T] unregulated upright stove (24 g) or [Soto OD-1R Micro](https://sotooutdoors.com/product/microregulator-stove/) regulated stove (73 g). The BRS-3000T has an aluminium thread and should be treated gently, whereas Fire Maple 300T Hornet (45 g) has a brass thread.

BRS is regarded as an unsafe copy of Fire Maple, which in turn Kovea has better quality control than either brands.
Minimizing waste [G-works Gas Saver Plus]
#### Super Cat alcohol stove
The [Super Cat](http://jwbasecamp.com/Articles/SuperCat/) (7 g) can be difficult to extinguish which made me miss the [Trangia](http://www.trangia.se/english/5612.25_series_ul.html) (110 g) which came with a simmer cap and a screw-on lid. The [Zelph's Modified Starlyte](http://www.woodgaz-stove.com/modified-starlyte-burner.php) (17 g) would be easy to snuff out while still being lighter than brass. 
#### Reynolds aluminum foil windscreen
Home-made aluminum foils are accessible, but filmsy. More durable alternative would be the [Qiwiz Titanium UL Windscreens](http://qiwiz.net/Windscreens.html) (15g - 35 g) or [Suluk 46 Titanium Windscreen](https://suluk46.com/product/titanium-windscreen/) (10 - 19 g)

A more suitable alternative to the Trangia windscreen (326 g) would be the [Trail Designs Sidewinder Ti-Tri](https://www.traildesigns.com/products/sidewinder-ti-tri) (30 g - 42 g) which are more fuel-efficient and retain more heat.
### Clothes
### Photography
Sony RX100 III or IV. GoPro HERO4

[Seek Outside Exposure](http://store.seekoutside.com/unaweep-exposure-panel-loader/) panel loader would be an excellent gift for the girlfriend.
[TrailPix](http://www.trail-pix.com/)
[Phoneskope](https://www.phoneskope.com/)
[Jaktvision Kamera Väst](https://www.jaktvision.se/store/p/0/kamera-v%C3%A4st-364582)
## Concerns
### Clothes
#### Rain Gears
#### Gloves
#### Overmitts
#### VPL Boots
#### Traction Spikes
#### Icepicks
[Suluk 46 TiCa Ice Tool](https://suluk46.com/product/tica-ice-tool-r5/) (122 - 240 g).
#### GPS Watches
Suunto Ambit3 Peak, Garmin Fenix 3
#### Altimeter Watches
